This is the process as I recall it, perhaps I've misunderstood something.


The system uses four microbit roles and a PC:

Starter microbit (start and refresh signal sender)

Runner microbit= (countdown + timing + calculation)

End microbit (finish signal sender)

Server microbit (USB serial bridge to PC)

PC (data parsing + visualisation)

//Workflow

The starter microbit sends a "START" radio message to begin the race.

Each runner microbit receives "START", plays a countdown with sound, and records the start timestamp.

When a runner reaches the finish, the end microbit sends an "END1" or "END2" message A, B bottons.

The corresponding runner micro:bit receives its end message, records the end timestamp, and calculates total running time and average speed (distance / time)

Each runner sends the time and speed to the server microbit.

The server microbit forwards the result messages to the PC.

The PC reads the serial data and visualises the results by scatter plot and bar chart.
